```sh
# Run ignition template server.
./ignition-server/ignition.sh

# Run wireguard vpn server on host machine.
## The wireguard vpn server is running on host machine with podman.
## The wireguard vpn server is used to connect k8s nodes.
./host_vpn_server.sh

# Run fedora core os on qemu. (k8s running on fedora core os)
## The fedora core os is running on qemu.
## The fedora core os is used to run k8s cluster.
./init_kube_vm_qemu.sh
```
